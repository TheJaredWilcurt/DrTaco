          <li>Cinematic - Hospital, Taco Sr. Death</li>

          <pre>

            Exterior shot of a hospital. Day time. Cut to the inside of a darkened hospital room. We see a taco shaped outline on the bed covered by a sheet. In the corner of the room, Dr. Taco sits, hunched over, his head in his hands. A nurse walks in.

            NURSE: We need you to sign these release papers so we can take him.

            We see a close-up of the paperwork. "Relation to deceased: Son". We now know that Dr. Taco's father... is dead. He signs the papers and hands them back.

            NURSE: I know it won't matter much now, but the lab results came back. The food poisoning that killed your father came from the hotdogs he had earlier today. We also found an unknown chemical. It's not like anything we've seen before. This chemical, once in his taco blood stream, is likely what killed him.

            DR TACO: Then I've got a hot dog vendor to track down...

            Exterior shot of the hospital again. We see Dr. Taco bust out of a window. The first 2D Platform level starts.

          <li>Cinematic - Hot Dog Vendor</li>

          <pre>
            As Dr. Taco approaches in 2D platformer mode, we see people around the area looking sick. Some are sitting on the curb. People are holding their stomachs. One guy is hunched over facing a wall, his hand on the wall over his head like he might throw up. Cut to animated cinematic.

            DR TACO: You! The hot dogs you sold to my father killed him!

            VENDOR: Yes, yes. An unfortunate side effect. Not everyone is strong enough to survive... THE TRANSFORMATION! HAHAHA!

            All of a sudden, those around you that looked sick start turning in to hot dog monsters!

            DR TACO: You'll pay for what you've done to these people... and for what you did to my father!

          <li>Boss Battle - Hot Dog Vendor</li>

          <li>Cinematic - Post-fight, time machine</li>

          <pre>
            Much like the first level in Megaman X, this battle keeps going until you lose. When your health bar is almost completely depleted, we switch back to another cinematic.

            We see Dr. Taco on his knees, beaten. He looks weak, exhausted, and out of breath. His taco shell is chipped, he's got a bandaid near his face and a black eye.

            VENDOR: HAHAHA! I guess weakness runs in your family! You're done Dr. Taco.

            DR TACO: NO! I didn't spend 7 years in Mexican Taco Medical School to be beaten by a CHUMP like you! PUNCH!

            Dr. Taco is grabbing the hot dog vendor by the suspenders while he gives his speech leading up to a punch in the face. The punch knocks the vendor backwards knocking over the hotdog cart. The cart sparks with little electrical symbols around it. The vendor flashes a few times before dieing (death animation). A blue orb of light and electricity expand outward from the cart encompassing Dr. Taco. Then the orb shrinks back down to nothing.

          <pre>
            We are now in a futuristic, but impovershed city at night. An orb appears near a broken chain link fence growing outwards then dissapating revealing Dr. Taco and the hot dog cart time machine.

            DR TACO: Holy Guacamole! What is this place?

            Dr. Taco continues on wards through two side scrollers then climbs upwards on stage three. As you climb higher, paralax in the background reveals the open roof stadium where King Corndog is giving a speech.

          <pre>
            KING CORNDOG: My fellow Hotdog Monsters! We stand today, in Hotdogtropolis, the great capital of our nation. I stand before you, on this momentus occasion, to tell you a beautiful truth. Our dream has come true. We have arrived at a bright future for all hotdog kind.... We have conquered and converted over 3/4th's of the human race, giving them the honor of joining the superior hotdog nation. And for the few disgusting humans that are left, we have been generous enough to allow them to serve us as a lower class...

            At some point Dr. Taco starts to talk over the speech

            DR TACO: I can't let this happen, I've got to use that time machine to

          </fieldset>

          <pre>
              England - 1817 - Mary Shelley's Haunted Mansion - Spooky Spooky Horror Level
              First stage: You time travel in by the front door on the bottom floor of the mansion and move right to proceed. You work your way across fighting Hot Dog Ghosts.
              At the end of the first floor there is a stair case that leads up and to the left, just after it is Mary Shelley's Science lab.

              DR TACO: What's going on here

              MARY: Hot dog monsters have been invading. I was experimenting on the body of one to discover a way to stop them.

              MARY: During my experiments with electricity I unintentionally reanimated the monster FrankenFurter, but upon returning to life he fled upstairs.

              MARY: Worse though, it seems due to the eletrical output of my insturments during the experiment a parabolic temporal flux caused a phase specturm disruption.

              DR TACO: ...I have no idea what that means

              MARY: There are ghosts all over the place!

              DR TACO: Oh... Yeah, I noticed that on my way in. Any idea how do we get rid of them.

              MARY: I've just finished working on a device that can perform a total protonic reversal.

              DR TACO: Uh huh... sooooooo

              MARY: It stops ghosts

              DR TACO: Got it! Okay, I think I can handle that, how do I use it?

              MARY: Ha! Why would I trust it with you, I don't even know your name.

              DR TACO: I'm Doctor Taco.

              MARY: Mary Shelley.

              Mary use a proton pack (ghost busters) to assist you on your ascent. Each floor is a new stage with different enemies and wholes in the floor.
              After reaching the top you walk in on a conversation between BratWORST and Frankenfurter.

              BRATWORST: You're worthless Frankenfurter! You're not a real monster. Do you even have desires of world domination.

              FRANKENFURTER: I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want to be left alone.

              BRATWORST: Disgrace, I can't allow you to besmirch the reputation of the great hot dog empire.

              BratWORST punches Frankenfurter knocking him down

              MARY: Hey, leave him alone! Who do you think you are?

              BRATWORST: I'm BratWORST and I only take orders from King Corndog.

              FRANKENFURTER: He's right, I can't fight him... too strong, just run

              MARY: Come on Frank, don't listen to him, you just need a little help.

              Mary flips the dial forward on her proton pack, a charge sound is made and then she fires electricity at Frankenfurter to charge him up.
              He stands up quickly and knocks BratWORST down. The fight begins with BratWORST stunned. The gameplay mechanic here involves Mary zapping Frankenfurter
              to charge him up, he knocks out BratWORST and then you're able to take his health down before he comes back up and rages.

              After the fight:

              MARY: Let's get out of here Frank, I think it's time we start new lives. Don't know what I'll do for work now though.

              DR TACO: Maybe you should take up writing.

              MARY: Not a bad idea, honestly though, I could use a vacation.

              FRANKENFURTER: I've always wanted to see Geneva.

              DR TACO: Good luck you guys.
